ants
====

Ant foraging simulation coded in JavaScript.
The ants have been implemented following a state machine, where they first
perform a random walk and then they fetch food indefinitely. The
foraging behaviour is cast as a biologically-inspired search algorithm for 
an optimisation procedure, considering that the objective is a cost 
function to be minimised.
